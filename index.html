        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! Iâ€™m Harvey, I have a strong passion and drive for everything Computer Science. I started my digital journey young, initially teaching myself to code Lua so that I could make my own 'ROBLOX' game.
             I ended up becoming very profficient with Roblox's adaption of Lua, Luau. I used this skill to begin creating ROBLOX experiences, creating my first game at 11. Since then, I have expanded my knowledge even further,
             and have multiple ROBLOX projects to this day, with my most popular reaching over 10,000 unique player visits and 200+ 'favourites' within its first 3 months of launch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, I am focusing on expanding my knowledge even further in the digital space, and transferring my skills in game design, UI/graphic design and coding into more complex use-cases. Currently, I am mastering Python,
            while also learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. I'm doing all of this while effectively managing multiple communities from games I have developed, and pushing updates regularly to keep the user experience fresh.

        <div class="skill1">
            <h2>Coding Languages</h2>
            <p>I am fluent in multiple coding languages, some more than others. Currently, Lua/Luau is the language I'm most familiar with, as it is what the Roblox Studio development engine uses, which is something I have spent a long time mastering. In close second is python, as it is the language I studied mainly throughout secondary school, and I've made many small-medium sized projects with it. The honourable mentions are HTML, CSS and JS, as this is what I'm currently paying most of my attention to, and one of the main reasons I'm creating this website from scratch is to learn them.</p>

        <div class="skill2">
            <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
            <p>Although it isn't my main focus when it comes to development, I'm fully familiar with the 'Blender' software, and how to use it efficiently to create 3D Models. I mainly use this skill to aid in development for games, however I have also looked into utilising Blender for things like animations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill3">
            <h2>Graphic/UI Design</h2>
            <p>I have experience with designing UIs and graphics from my time spent with ROBLOX development, where UI is a very important factor of how a game plays. I am well versed with many common graphic design applications, and I understand the basics of colour theory aswell as how to create an appealing User Interface.</p>

        <div class="project1">
            <h2>'East German Border' - ROBLOX Experience</h2>
            <p>
                East German Border is a project that I spent 8 months developing, the game contains over 200 code 'scripts', the vast majority of those were
                written by hand, by me. Every aspect of the game, aside from a couple scripts that were commissioned by me from other developers, I created.
                I taught myself all of the skills needed for this (Lua Coding, Game Design, Graphics/UI Design e.t.c), and I continue to use those skills today in other projects and updates for 'East German Border'.
