        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! Iâ€™m Harvey, I have a strong passion and drive for everything Computer Science. I started my digital journey young, initially teaching myself to code Lua so that I could make my own 'ROBLOX' game.
             I ended up becoming very proficient with Roblox's adaptation of Lua, Luau. I used this skill to begin creating ROBLOX experiences, creating my first game at 11. Since then, I have expanded my knowledge even further,
             and have multiple ROBLOX projects to this day, with my most popular reaching over 10,000 unique player visits and 200+ 'favourites' within its first 3 months of launch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, I am focusing on expanding my knowledge even further in the digital space, and transferring my skills in game design, UI/graphic design and coding into more complex use-cases. Currently, I am mastering Python,
            while also learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. I'm doing all of this while effectively managing multiple communities from games I have developed, and pushing updates regularly to keep the user experience fresh.

        <h1>My Skillset</h1>

        <div class="skill1">
            <h2>Coding Languages</h2>
            <p>I am fluent in multiple coding languages, some more than others. Currently, Lua/Luau is the language I'm most familiar with, as it is what the Roblox Studio development engine uses, which is something I have spent a long time mastering. In close second is python, as it is the language I studied mainly throughout secondary school, and I've made many small-medium sized projects with it. The honourable mentions are HTML, CSS and JS, as this is what I'm currently paying most of my attention to, and one of the main reasons I'm creating this website from scratch is to learn them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill2">
            <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
            <p>Although it isn't my main focus when it comes to development, I'm fully familiar with the 'Blender' software, and how to use it efficiently to create 3D Models. I mainly use this skill to aid in development for games, however I have also looked into utilising Blender for things like animations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="skill3">
            <h2>Graphic/UI Design</h2>
            <p>I have experience with designing UIs and graphics from my time spent with ROBLOX development, where UI is a very important factor of how a game plays. I am well versed with many common graphic design applications, and I understand the basics of colour theory as well as how to create an appealing User Interface.</p>

            <h2>'East German Border' - ROBLOX Experience</h2>
            <p>
                East German Border is a project that I spent 8 months developing, the coding aspect of the game contains over 200 code 'scripts', the vast majority of those were
                written by hand, by me. Every aspect of the game, aside from a couple of scripts that were commissioned by me from other developers, I created from scratch.
                I taught myself all of the skills needed for this (Lua Coding, Game Design, Graphics/UI Design etc.), and I continue to use those skills today in other projects and updates for 'East German Border'.
                'East German Border' is a ROBLOX experience that portrays the division between East and West germany as it were in the 1980's, with the option to play as a soldier, politician and more.

            <h2>Blender Modelling</h2>
            <p>
                I have experience with 3D Modelling in Blender, I taught myself this skill as it was crucial to development of my ROBLOX game, and it can be useful in all areas of digital development. All images below except the porsche
                were both created from scratch and rendered by me.

            <sub>
                The porsche model is open-sourced. However, it was rendered and had its lighting setup by me.

        <div class="project3">
            <h2>COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT</h2>
            <p>Throughout my time in game development, I've also realised that managing the community properly around your game is just as crucial. I've had many years of community management, taking administrative roles in communities for other games that I have helped to develop,
                as well as obviously managing the community of my own game. This means I have experience with things like creating documentation, spreadsheets, planners/organisers and marketing, which are all crucial to running a community effectively and smoothly.
