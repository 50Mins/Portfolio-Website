        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Harvey, I have a strong passion and drive for everything Computer Science. I started my CS journey young, initially teaching myself to code Lua so that I could make my own 'ROBLOX' game. I ended up becoming very profficient with Roblox's Lua-u language, and have made to this day multiple successful games that were able to bring in a strong income aswell as provide a strong user experience. However, nowadays I am expanding my CS knowledge, working on fully mastering python, aswell as HTML and CSS, which is one of the reasons I'm creating this website from scratch.</p>

        <h1>My Skillset</h1>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Coding Languages</h2>
            <p>I am fluent in multiple coding languages, some more than others. Currently, Lua/Luau is the language I'm most familiar with, as it is what the Roblox Studio development engine uses, which is something I have spent a long time mastering. In close second is python, as it is the language I studied mainly throughout secondary school, and I've made many small-medium sized projects with it. The honourable mentions are HTML, CSS and JS, as this is what I'm currently paying most of my attention to, and one of the main reasons I'm creating this website from scratch is to learn them.</p>

        <div class="project2">
            <h2>3D Modelling</h2>
            <p>Although it isn't my main focus when it comes to development, I'm fully familiar with the 'Blender' software, and how to use it efficiently to create 3D Models. I mainly use this skill to aid in development for games, however I have also looked into utilising Blender for things like animations.</p>

        <div class="project3">
            <h2>Graphic/UI Design</h2>
            <p>I have experience with designing UIs and graphics from my time spent with ROBLOX development, where UI is a very important factor of how a game plays. I am well versed with many common graphic design applications, and I understand the basics of colour theory aswell as how to create an appealing User Interface.</p>
